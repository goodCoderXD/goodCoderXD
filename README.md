# GoodCoderXD

I work at a company where I just write python scripts for a living. I don't improve ever. My old github is poisoned with too many repos I won't touch.
This account is my commitment to improving as a dev. Below are projects in the order they were created.

## [Multi-language Leetcode Repo](https://github.com/goodCoderXD/multi-lang-leetcode)
A collection of leetcode problems solved in multiple languages. Doing this for every day I don't add to a project.
